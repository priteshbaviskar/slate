```

The purpose of this documentation is to understand the list of available Storeplum APIs and their corresponding requests and response for a seamless integration of Storeplum with your app. Storeplum API 1.0 allows data to be created, read and updated using requests in JSON format and using standard REST HTTP methods which are understood by most of the HTTP clients.

The current Storeplum REST API integration version is `v1` which takes a first-order position in endpoints. 

The documentation language binding is in Shell. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


## Request/Response Format

The default response format is JSON. Requests with a responseMessage-body use plain JSON to set or update resource attributes. Successful requests will return a `200 OK HTTP` status.

Some general information about responses:

1. Resource IDs are returned as integers.
2. Any decimal monetary amount, such as prices or totals, will be returned as **Number** with two decimal places. 
3. Other amounts, such as item counts, are returned as integers. 
4. Blank fields are generally included as null or emtpy **String** instead of being omitted.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.storeplum.in/integration/example-endpoint" \
  -H "X-SP-INTEGRATION: <YOUR-API-KEY>"
```
> Make sure to replace the value for header `x-sp-integration` with your API key.


Each incoming request from your app to Storeplum API has to be authenticated using an API key. Storeplum uses pre-generated API key for external integrations which can be obtained in [Storeplum Dashboard](https://dashboard.storeplum.in/) under integrations section. 

In this section, you will see a list of supported apps by Storeplum. Click on your app and select `Activate`. Once activated, you will see the API key for this integration on the screen. Copy this key and please make sure to save it in a secure location as it won't be available to view again later.

In case you forget your API key, deactivate the integration and activate it again to get a new key.


![Activating Zapier integration for Storeplum](images/image-zapier.png)

<!-- ```java
import okhttp3.*;

Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url(url)
                .post(body)
                .addHeader("X-SP-INTEGRATION", <YOUR-API-KEY>)
                .build();
Response response = okHttpClient.newCall(request).execute();
``` -->

<!-- ```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
``` -->


Storeplum uses the above API key to allow access to the APIs. Include this API key in all requests to Storeplum API in a header with name `X-SP-INTEGRATION`

`X-SP-INTEGRATION: <YOUR-API-KEY>`

<!-- <aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR-API-KEY</code> with your personal API key.
</aside> -->

# Products

Product entity is the crux of every online store built on Storeplum. Products can be added manually through Storeplum dashboard or through external API integration services like Zapier and others.

**Product States**

Following are the various states of a `Product`

Status | Description
------ | -----------
`UPCOMING` | When a new product is added in a Storeplum account, it's default state is `UPCOMING`. From here, the Product can move to either `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE` state. Products with status `UPCOMING` are not visible on the online store.
`ACTIVE` | A product can be marked as `ACTIVE` only when all of it's attributes are added and relevant product images are uploaded. `ACTIVE` products are visible on the online store.
`INACTIVE` | A product can be marked as `INACTIVE` when a user no longer wants it to be visible on their online store. In certain cases like no inventory, A product moves to `INACTIVE` state by default. An inactive product can be moved back to be active through Storeplum dashboard.


## Create Product

```shell

curl "https://api.storeplum.in/integration/action/product/save" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
  -H "X-SP-INTEGRATION: <YOUR-API-KEY>"\
  -d '{
    "customerCode": "your-storeplum-customer-code",
    "productName": "Product name",
    "productDescription": "Product description",
    "productSEOTag": "product-seo-tag",
    "productCategorySeoTag": "product-category-seo-tag",
    "originalPrice": 123.45,
    "basePrice": 123.45,
    "configDefaultDraftName": "Product default configuration name",
    "productionTimeEstimate": 7,
    "taxRate": 12.5,
    "isTaxInclusive": true,
    "skuCount": 1200
  }'

```
> Successful Response `200 OK`

```json
{
  "isSuccess": true,
  "responseMessage": "success",
  "object": {
    "product" : {
      "productID": 123
    }
  }
}
```

> Failed Response `400 BAD REQUEST`

```json
{
  "isSuccess": false,
  "responseMessage": "Invalid input",
  "object": {}
  
}
```

# Webhooks

Storeplum API allows you to listen to various platform events through webhooks. Simply add register your webhook url for a specific event that you'd like to listen to and Storeplum will send you a push notification as soon as the event is triggered. 

The following events are currently supported by platform-

1. New Customer Event
2. New Product Event
3. New Order Event
4. Order Shipped Event

<aside class="warning">You can only register a HTTPS url as a webhook. All HTTP urls will be ignored by default.</aside>
